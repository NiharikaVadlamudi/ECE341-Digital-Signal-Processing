This project gave me my first experiance of working with speech signals . I understood how Group Delay was a significant feature 
and how it tremendously contributed to speech technology . There is depth and vastness to the paper , that could take months of work
to fully analyse . I am glad I have managed to simulate few results and appreciate its beauty . I sincerely thank my project mentor
Gurugubelli Krishna , for being the most calmest and absolutely genius mentor I've ever come accross .
